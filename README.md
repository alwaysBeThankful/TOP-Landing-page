# TOP-Landing-page

This is a Landing page exercise from The Odin Project for me to complete. My task was to closely copy what they have completed with instructions given for colours, font, font size an so on. 

I have tried my best with the exercise with detailed feedback in the Git Logs. I hope this inspires someone who is struggling or wants a refrence should it help finishing this exercise. 

Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience and I am grateful for my skillset in coding to be advancing and expanding.
